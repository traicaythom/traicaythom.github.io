                    Vietnam. This province is well-known for the hot and dry weather which is often considered to be 
                    the optimal condition to grow the white dragon fruit plants. Additionally, its semi-dessert geology is 
                    also the key factor to produce the most tasteful dragon fruits in Vietnam. Combining these 
                    factors and the location near Vietnam's biggest metropolitan, our farms can provide and

                    Dragon fruit naturally bears fruits for 5 months every year, usually from early summer through 
                    mid-fall. It begins flowering in early summer, typically in June, with fruit formation occurring 
                    shortly afterward. With new lighting technology and biological understanding of dragon fruit, 
                    we succeed in producing dragon fruit all year long. This achievement also thanks to the suitable 
                    geology and weather condition in Binh Thuan province.

                    In more than 20 years of growing dragon fruit plants, we always consider quality over quantity. 
                    At the early stage of the fruits, 
                    our experienced farmers will pick out only the best quality sentiments to let them grow to full size. 
                    This method helps prevent the tree from weakening while providing it with sufficient energy to 
                    produce the fruit. As a result, only high-quality and hand-picked fruits are collected and 
                    delivered to customers.
